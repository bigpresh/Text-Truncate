NAME
    Text::Truncate - Perl module with simple string truncating routine

REQUIREMENTS
    This module only uses standard modules. It should run on Perl 5.004.

INSTALLATION
    Installation is pretty standard:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make test
      make install

    (On Windows platforms you should use nmake instead.)

    Using Build.PL (if you have Module::Build installed):

      perl Build.PL
      perl Build test
      perl Build install    

SYNOPSIS
      use Text::Truncate;

      my $long_string = "This is a very long string";

      # outputs "This is..."
      print truncstr( $long_string, 10);

      # outputs "This is a-"
      print truncstr( $long_string, 10, "-");

      # outputs "This is a "
      print truncstr( $long_string, 10, "");

      # outputs "This is---"
      $Text::Truncate::DEFAULT_MARKER = "---";
      print truncstr( $long_string, 10);

DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple, no-brainer subroutine to truncate a string and add an
    optional cutoff marker (defaults to ``...'').

    (Yes, this is a really brain-dead sort of thing to make a module out of,
    but then again, I use it so often that it might as well be in a module.)

    The synopsis gives examples of how to use it.
